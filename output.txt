Ouch a rabbit whispers slowly.
An amazing storm falls a smoke.
Oh a graceful deer hopes.
A thunder destroys noisily.

Goodbye a bear groans at a bird.
A tornado shatter through a scorching earthquake.
A tsunami flows off a hoping lightning.
An ashen blizzard flows swiftly.

A fish drinks.
A volcano roars a fire.
A fox knows.
Yay a lion weeps down a wolf.
